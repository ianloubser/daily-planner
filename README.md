# Daily planner

Very simple webapp to manage your daily tasks.

Daily planner is meant to be the simplest way to ensure your work gets done and nothing ever drops off your plate. Just add any new adhoc items and only focus on tasks prioritized for today. Any unfinished tasks in a given day will carry over as higher priorities in the next day to ensure you get to wrap up all your important work.

Signin with Google to persist all tasks and access from any device. Also link it to your google calendar to easily block out focus times to ensure completion of long standing open items.

## Technical notes

Apart from a useful quick tool in my own life, this was also an experiment to see how much one can achieve with as much as possible vanilla web libraries/SDK's and javascript. Only unique UI library used is hot.js - the smallest declarative[ish] javascript UI framework, no bundlers or extensive dev env setup needed. Load it into your webpage and just start coding straight away.
